        <p class="main">In this digital age, it's grossly easy to access lifetimes upon lifetimes worth of information. Everything we've ever wanted and more is right at our fingertips. Though, because our screens are so easily accessible, they serve as one of the most prevalent distractions.</p>

            <h2>Public Enemy #1</h2>
            <p>Social media is so popular, it's nigh impossible to find someone that doesn't use it. "Doomscrolling" is a phenomenon that's rapidly grown in popularity in the past couple of years since COVID-19. By definition, doomscrolling is the act of "spend[ing] excessive time online scrolling through news or other content that makes one feel sad, anxious, angry, etc." (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doomscroll">Thank you, Merriam-Webster!</a>). Though, I've personally seen the term used to refer to the consumption of short-form content in general (e.g. TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.)</p>

                <h2>Who Cares?</h2>
            <p>Social media is designed to be a distraction. When a person engages in doomscrolling, it effectively "trains the brain" to seek instant gratification. It becomes harder to pull away from your screen to focus on more difficult activities that don't immediately provide a reward.</p>
                <h3>Reasons To Scroll</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not interested in doing work</li>
                    <li>Want to escape</li>
                    <li>Want a distraction</li>
                    <li>Cannot focus</li>
