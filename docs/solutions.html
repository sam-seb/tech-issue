            <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>As a college student and chronic procrastinator, I'm no stranger to study troubles. Sitting down and focusing on work has never been my strong suit. In fact, many may call it my weak suit! I want to share what turned my insurmountable pile of work into something more manageable in the hopes that even just one person finds it to be helpful.</p>

            
            <h3>My Method</h3>
            <p class="small">Disclaimer: This is something that has worked for <strong>ME PERSONALLY</strong>. I do not claim to be an all-knowing expert.</p>
            <p class="small">Another disclaimer: This is a very small example! My checklists are usally longer and in much more detail.</p>
            <p>I've boiled my struggles down to three (3) main issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting started</li>
                <li>Knowing what to do</li>
                <li>Staying focused</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>What I've taken to doing recently is [EXPLAINNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!]</p>

            <h4>Why this works (for me):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I have trouble getting started because I don't know where to start. My checklist tells me exactly where to begin.</li>
                <li>I often stuggle with figuring out what order to do things in. By listing everything, I give myself </li>
                <li>By giving myself breaks to look forward to, studying feels like a less exhausting task.</li>
            </ul>
