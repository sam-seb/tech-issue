        <h1 class="title">What Can We Even Do?</h1>
        <p class="main">Even if technology is destroying attention spans, we can still use technology to fix them! All it takes is a bit of discipline...</p>

            <h2>Strategic Breaks</h2>
               <p>A few strategically placed breaks could make all the difference. <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans">Gloria Mark</a>, a psychologist, recommends taking breaks at natural stopping points in tasks. Take one after finishing a paragraph, or when you move from physical to digital work. It's much easier to resume working if it's clear where you left off, instead of spending time and effort figuring out what you were previously doing.</p>

            <h2>Utilize tools</h2>
            <p>Tools exist to assist us. It would almost be doing a disservice to not use them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Pomodoro Technique: Using a timer, set yourself 25-minute work intervals followed by 5-minute break intervals. Times can be adjusted per person.</li>
                <li>Screentime Limits: Limiting your screentime could be beneficial if you find your phone to be too distracting.</li>
                <li>Planners: Many, many people use planners in their day-to-day lives. A physical one works, but there's also a calender app on most phones.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>What works for you?</h2>
            <p>At the end of the day, it really is a case-by-case basis. What works for one person might not work for the next. So, it's worth trying different methods of focusing at least once, just to see. Meditate, use a planner, set alarms, change environments... et cetra and so forth.</p>

            <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>Sitting down and focusing on work has never been my strong suit. In fact, many may call it my weak suit! I want to share what turned my insurmountable pile of work into something more manageable in the hopes that even just one person finds it to be helpful.</p>

            
            <h3>My Method</h3>
            <p class="small">Disclaimer: This is something that has worked for <strong>ME PERSONALLY</strong>. I do not claim to be an all-knowing expert.</p>
            <p>I've boiled my struggles down to three (3) main issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting started</li>
                <li>Knowing what to do</li>
                <li>Staying focused</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>What I've taken to doing recently is listing every step of every assignment. I get real nitty-gritty with it. Just below, I've created a very watered down example:</p>
            
            <form>
                <h4 class="list">Assignment 1: Tech Guide</h4>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt1" name="pt1" value="1">
                <label for="pt1">Skim through sources initially. Once finished, read in more depth and take notes, preferably by hand.</label><br>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt2" name="pt2" value="2">
                <label for="pt2">Open a Google doc and rearrange written notes into categories that make sense. Don't worry about making it cohesive.</label><br>
                <p>15 minute break</p>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt3" name="pt3" value="3">
                <label for="pt3">Create HTML files for each page.. Add content from the Google Doc to HTML, formatting as you go. Create structure. Don't worry about making it pretty.</label><br>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt4" name="pt4" value="4">
                <label for="pt4">Once all information has been transferred and everything is structured nicely, pretty it up using CSS</label><br>
                <p>30 minute break</p>    
                <h4 class="list">Assignment 2: Final Presentation</h4>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt5" name="pt5" value="5">
                <label for="pt5">Open Google Slides and create 5 total slides, since that is the limit for this assignment.</label><br>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt6" name="pt6" value="6">
                <label for="pt6">Use information from previous assignments to add content to the slides. Divide into sections that make sense. Don't worry about how it looks right now.</label><br>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt7" name="pt7" value="7">
                <label for="pt7">After all information has been added, now format it and make it look nice.</label><br>
                <input type="checkbox" id="pt8" name="pt8" value="8">
                <label for="pt8">Add images/visuals/illustrations</label><br>
                <p>All done :)</p>
            </form>
            <br/>
            <h4>Why this works (for me):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I have trouble getting started because I don't know where to start. My checklist tells me exactly where to begin.</li>
                <li>I often stuggle with figuring out what order to do things in. By listing everything, I give myself </li>
                <li>By giving myself breaks to look forward to, studying feels like a less exhausting task.</li>
            </ul>
